## Kabyle Speech To Text model (Pytorch)

The model was generated using 700k audio sentences in Kabyle languages, along with their texts.
The model is generated under the name "best_kabyle_asr_optim.pt".
The use of a GPU is recommended.


#### Operation

##### Install the necessary python libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

##### Testing the trained model
- Run the "kab_audio_model_test.py" file:
  python kab_audio_model_test.py

- Load your MP3 file via the interface generated by gradio (click on the link provided in the script launch feedback).

##### Training a model with your own audio files

1- Put your MP3 files in the "audios" folder
2- Update the "transcription.csv" file with your own information, respecting this format: audio file name;audio file phrase

audio_file;transcription

common_voice_kab_21869653.mp3;Ssnent ad wtent apyanu

common_voice_kab_21869655.mp3;Iḥeqqa tekkateḍ imẓad

common_voice_kab_21869656.mp3;Lliɣ ssedhuyeɣ igerdan

3- Run the "train_kab.py" file
python train_kab.py

##### IMPORTANT:
- You need to have at least 5000 audio files and their sentences in order to have a coherent model.
- The separation between the name of the audio file and its phrase must be a semicolon.
- Replace semicolons with spaces in your sentences before putting them in the transcription file.
- Adjust the script parameters according to the capacity of your GPU:
    - BATCH_SIZE
    - num_worker
    - prefetch_factor

#### Recommended configuration for CUDA (optional)
- Make sure your NVIDIA driver and CUDA Toolkit are compatible:
- NVIDIA driver >= 530.xx
- CUDA Toolkit 12.1 (for cu121)
