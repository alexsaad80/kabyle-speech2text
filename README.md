## 📚 Overview

The Kabyle speech recognition model has been designed to transform audio recordings in Kabyle into written text. The optimized model is available under the name `best_kabyle_asr_optim.pt`.

> **Note**: Using a GPU is strongly recommended for optimal performance.

## 🖥️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+ 
- PyTorch
- CUDA-compatible GPU (strongly recommended)
- Sufficient disk space for training data

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexsaad80/kabyle-speech2text.git
cd kabyle-speech2text
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Testing the Pre-trained Model

1. Run the test script:
```bash
python kab_audio_model_test.py
```

2. A Gradio interface will be generated - follow the link displayed in the console
3. Upload your MP3 audio file via the interface to get the transcription

### Custom Training

To train the model with your own audio files:

1. Place your MP3 files in the `audios/` folder

2. Update the `transcription.csv` file with your information, following this format:
```
audio_file_name;transcription
common_voice_kab_21869653.mp3;Ssnent ad wtent apyanu
common_voice_kab_21869655.mp3;Iḥeqqa tekkateḍ imẓad
common_voice_kab_21869656.mp3;Lliɣ ssedhuyeɣ igerdan
```

3. Launch the training:
```bash
python train_kab.py
```

## ⚙️ Recommended CUDA Configuration

For optimal performance, ensure your CUDA installation is compatible:
- NVIDIA driver ≥ 530.xx
- CUDA Toolkit 12.1 (for cu121)

To check your CUDA version:
```bash
nvcc --version
```

## 💡 Best Practices and Tips

- **Data Volume**: A minimum of 5,000 audio files with their transcriptions is necessary to obtain a coherent model.
- **Data Format**: 
  - Use a semicolon (`;`) as a separator between the audio filename and its transcription
  - Replace any semicolons with spaces in your sentences before integrating them into the transcription file
- **Performance Optimization**: Adjust the script parameters according to your GPU capabilities:
  - `BATCH_SIZE`
  - `num_worker`
  - `prefetch_factor`

## 📈 Performance

The pre-trained model `best_kabyle_asr_optim.pt` offers the best performance and has been optimized for Kabyle speech recognition.
